<p>Patched into the aircraft's data port, you discover weather forecasts of a
massive tropical storm. Before you can figure out whether it will impact
your vacation plans, however, your device suddenly turns off!</p>
<p>Its battery is dead.</p>
<p>You'll need to plug it in. There's only one problem: the charging outlet
near your seat produces the wrong number of <strong>jolts</strong>. Always prepared, you
make a list of all of the joltage adapters in your bag.</p>
<p>Each of your joltage adapters is rated for a specific <strong>output joltage</strong>
(your puzzle input). Any given adapter can take an input <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>3</code>
jolts <strong>lower</strong> than its rating and still produce its rated output joltage.</p>
<p>In addition, your device has a built-in joltage adapter rated for <code>3</code> jolts
<strong>higher</strong> than the highest-rated adapter in your bag. (If your adapter list
were <code>3</code>, <code>9</code>, and <code>6</code>, your device's built-in adapter would be rated for
<code>12</code> jolts.)</p>
<p>Treat the charging outlet near your seat as having an effective joltage
rating of <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>Since you have some time to kill, you might as well test all of your
adapters. Wouldn't want to get to your resort and realize you can't even
charge your device!</p>
<p>If you <strong>use every adapter in your bag</strong> at once, what is the distribution
of joltage differences between the charging outlet, the adapters, and your
device?</p>
<p>For example, suppose that in your bag, you have adapters with the following
joltage ratings:</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered">
<span class="number">16</span>
<span class="number">10</span>
<span class="number">15</span>
<span class="number">5</span>
<span class="number">1</span>
<span class="number">11</span>
<span class="number">7</span>
<span class="number">19</span>
<span class="number">6</span>
<span class="number">12</span>
<span class="number">4</span></pre></div>
<p>With these adapters, your device's built-in joltage adapter would be rated
for <code>19 + 3 = 22</code> jolts, 3 higher than the highest-rated adapter.</p>
<p>Because adapters can only connect to a source 1-3 jolts lower than its
rating, in order to use every adapter, you'd need to choose them like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The charging outlet has an effective rating of 0 jolts, so the only
adapters that could connect to it directly would need to have a joltage
rating of <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>3</code> jolts. Of these, only one you have is an
adapter rated <code>1</code> jolt (difference of <code>1</code>).</li>
<li>From your <code>1</code>-jolt rated adapter, the only choice is your <code>4</code>-jolt rated
adapter (difference of <code>3</code>).</li>
<li>From the <code>4</code>-jolt rated adapter, the adapters rated <code>5</code>, <code>6</code>, or <code>7</code> are
valid choices. However, in order to not skip any adapters, you have to
pick the adapter rated <code>5</code> jolts (difference of <code>1</code>).</li>
<li>Similarly, the next choices would need to be the adapter rated 6 and then
the adapter rated <code>7</code> (with difference of <code>1</code> and <code>1</code>).</li>
<li>The only adapter that works with the <code>7</code>-jolt rated adapter is the one
rated <code>10</code> jolts (difference of <code>3</code>).</li>
<li>From <code>10</code>, the choices are <code>11</code> or <code>12</code>; choose <code>11</code> (difference of <code>1</code>)
and then <code>12</code> (difference of <code>1</code>).</li>
<li>After <code>12</code>, only valid adapter has a rating of <code>15</code> (difference of <code>3</code>),
then <code>16</code> (difference of <code>1</code>), then <code>19</code> (difference of <code>3</code>).</li>
<li>Finally, your device's built-in adapter is always <code>3</code> higher than the
highest adapter, so its rating is <code>22</code> jolts (always a difference of <code>3</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, when using every adapter, there are <code>7</code> differences of <code>1</code>
jolt and <code>5</code> differences of <code>3</code> jolts.</p>
<p>Here is a larger example:</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered">
<span class="number">28</span>
<span class="number">33</span>
<span class="number">18</span>
<span class="number">42</span>
<span class="number">31</span>
<span class="number">14</span>
<span class="number">46</span>
<span class="number">20</span>
<span class="number">48</span>
<span class="number">47</span>
<span class="number">24</span>
<span class="number">23</span>
<span class="number">49</span>
<span class="number">45</span>
<span class="number">19</span>
<span class="number">38</span>
<span class="number">39</span>
<span class="number">11</span>
<span class="number">1</span>
<span class="number">32</span>

<span class="number">2</span>
<span class="number">34</span>
<span class="number">10</span>
<span class="number">3</span></pre></div>
<p>In this larger example, in a chain that uses all of the adapters, there are
<code>22</code> differences of <code>1</code> jolt and 10 differences of <code>3</code> jolts.</p>
<p>Find a chain that uses all of your adapters to connect the charging outlet
to your device's built-in adapter and count the joltage differences between
the charging outlet, the adapters, and your device. <strong>What is the number of
1-jolt differences multiplied by the number of 3-jolt differences?</strong></p>
<h2 id="----part-two----" class="section-header"><a href="#----part-two----">--- Part Two ---</a></h2>
<p>To completely determine whether you have enough adapters, you'll need to
figure out how many different ways they can be arranged. Every arrangement
needs to connect the charging outlet to your device. The previous rules
about when adapters can successfully connect still apply.</p>
<p>The first example above (the one that starts with <code>16</code>, <code>10</code>, <code>15</code>) supports
the following arrangements:</p>

<p>(The charging outlet and your device's built-in adapter are shown in
parentheses.) Given the adapters from the first example, the total number of
arrangements that connect the charging outlet to your device is 8.</p>
<p>The second example above (the one that starts with <code>28</code>, <code>33</code>, <code>18</code>) has
